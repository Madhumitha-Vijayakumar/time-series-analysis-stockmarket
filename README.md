# üìà Time Series Analysis & Forecasting: Stock Market

This project analyzes stock market trends using time series forecasting techniques, focusing on deep learning with an LSTM neural network.

## üìä **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to:
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data
- Visualize stock price trends
- Build and train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future prices
- Plot predicted vs actual stock prices

## ‚öô **Tech Stack & Libraries**
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- yfinance (for historical stock data)
- scikit-learn (data preprocessing)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for building LSTM model)

## üîç **Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
2. **Visualization**: Plot historical closing prices to observe trends and patterns.
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Scale data with MinMaxScaler
   - Create sequences suitable for LSTM input
4. **Modeling**:
   - Build a sequential LSTM model
   - Train the model to predict stock closing prices
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Plot predicted vs actual prices to visualize performance

## üìä **Visualization**
The notebook includes:
- Historical closing price plot
- Plot comparing actual vs predicted prices from the LSTM model

## ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**
- Hands-on implementation of time series forecasting using deep learning
- Experience with real-world stock market data
- Understanding data preprocessing steps for LSTM models
